\section{Introduction}
	Spiral packing is the process of filling a given area, or shape boundary, to a desired level with connected sets of spirals. The final goal of the spiral packing process is to generate designs that are space-filling and visually pleasing. This project aims to implement and evaluate the algorithm described in the paper "Spiral Packing" by Cameron Browne and Paul van Wamelen. Browne and Wamelen present an iterative method for producing connected spiral sets, utilizing circle approximations to significantly simplify the spiral packing problem.\cite{Browne2006834}

\subsection{Archimedes' Spiral}	
	The general polar equation for the Archimedean spiral is \begin{math}r = a\theta^\frac{1}{n}\end{math}. The implemented algorithm utilizes the special case of the Archimedean spiral (\begin{math}n=1\end{math}), known as Archimedes' spiral, described by the equation \begin{math}r = a\theta\end{math}. This special case was chosen by the authors because of its aesthetic and well-behaved mathematical qualities.\cite{Browne2006834} The Archimedes' spiral can be described in cartesian coordinates by the set of parameters \begin{math}(x,y,w,\theta,T,\omega)\end{math}, giving the equations:
	\begin{equation}x_{s}(t) = x + wt cos(\theta + 2\pi\omega t)\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}y_{s}(t) = y + wt sin(\theta + 2\pi\omega t)\end{equation}
for \begin{math}0 \leq t \leq T\end{math}, where \begin{math}(x,y)\end{math} is the spiral's center, \begin{math}w\end{math} is the width of one rotation, \begin{math}\theta\end{math} is the starting angle or phase, \begin{math}T\end{math} is the number of rotations or total sweep of the spiral, and \begin{math}\omega\end{math} is the orientation of the spiral (\begin{math}\omega = -1\end{math} for clockwise and \begin{math}\omega = 1\end{math} for counterclockwise).

\subsection{Spiral Packing}
	The goal of spiral packing is to create one or more connected spiral sets placed in such a way that the resulting generated image is space-filling and aesthetically pleasing. This artistic quality is achieved by emphasizing visual patterns when placing new spirals. The addition of color also helps to improve the overall aesthetics of the resulting images. Examples of generated images using the spiral packing algorithm are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example}. 
	The connected sets are generated by branching child spirals from parent spirals, adhering to the following constraints: A child spiral (1) may have at most one parent; (2) must not have a greater width than its parent; (3) must meet its parent tangentially; (4) must be rotated such that its terminal point lies on the line drawn between its center and its parent's center; and (5) may touch neighboring spirals tangentially but may not intersect them.

\end{figure}

	There are three general geometric cases to consider when generating connected spiral sets. The first, and most simple, of these cases is the branching of a child spiral that does not intersect any neighboring spirals, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:geo}a. This is handled simply by drawing the child spiral at the preferred location. The other two cases occur when the child spiral intersects one or two neighboring spirals  when attempting to place the child in the preferred location, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:geo}b and c respectively. In both cases, the child spiral may need to be resized or repositioned, within a threshold, so that it can lie tangent to the neighboring spirals. In the case of two neighboring spirals being intersected, the algorithm may not converge in a way to allow the child spiral to lie tangent to both neighbors. In this case, the maximally intersected neighbor is chosen as the spiral to position the child spiral tangent to.

\end{figure}

	To begin the generation of the connected spiral sets, the implemented program starts with one or more pairs of seed spirals from which the child spirals can branch. During the branching process, the user will need to provide a preferred location for the child spirals. The algorithm will take this preferred location in conjunction with the constraints listed above and the state of the packed area to attempt to place the child spiral. The goal is to place the child spiral as close to the user's preferred location as possible without violating the constraints.

\subsection{Apollonian Packing}
	To simplify the process of fitting a child spiral to neighboring spirals, the spirals are approximated using circles. This essentially reduces the spiral packing problem to the circle packing problem, also known as Apollonian packing. This simplification makes it easier to determine when child spirals intersect neighboring spirals and solving the circle packing problem for the circle of minimum radius provides a good approximation for the placement and size of the fitted child spiral.

\section{Results}
	The results of the algorithm will be evaluated in two ways. The first evaluation technique is purely visual; the algorithm must produce images that are aesthetically pleasing as well as space-filling. This is determined not only by the generated connected spiral sets adhering to the constraints listed above, but also by the coloring of the resulting images. In order to properly evaluate the robustness of the implementation, several images will be generated to demonstrate different packing scenarios, bounding areas, arrangements, and color schemes. The second way of evaluating the results is by calculating the \textit{porosity}, or the ratio of vacant area to the area covered by spirals. The lower the porosity, the better the packing. For the purposes of this project, a porosity of 5\% or lower will be considered a good packing.
