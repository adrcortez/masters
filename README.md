Spiral Packing
---

The program is packaged as an executable jar file. To run it, double
click the SpiralPacking.jar file.

The program starts by drawing a pair of seed spirals to start the
packing process.

There are three input fields for controlling the parameters of the
spirals to draw. These are:

- Sweep - the number of turns the spiral will have
- Width - the width of one rotation of the spiral
- Orientation - whether the spiral spins clockwise (-1) or counter-clockwise(1)

To change the value of any of the input fields, enter the new value into
the field and press the return key. If the value is invalid, an error
message will pop up.

Once the desired parameters are set, clicking anywhere on the drawing area
(the large white area) will draw the spiral with its center on that clicked 
point.
